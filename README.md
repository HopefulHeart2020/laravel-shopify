# Laravel Shopify App

*Work in progress/ for fun*.

A Laravel package for aiding in Shopify App integration, it will follow suit to `shopify_app` for Rails.

## Installation

Open `config/app.php` find `providers` array. Add a new line with:

`OhMyBrew\ShopifyApp\ShopifyAppProvider::class,`

## Notes

I have not touched PHP in years, I've been primarily a full-time Ruby developer. Please forgive any quirks :)
